**Brain Train** is a web-based game inspired by the *Stroop Effect*, a psychological phenomenon where it's difficult to name the color of the word instead of reading the word itself.

Built in memory of my mother and inspired by the rising need for tools that help older adults maintain cognitive function, this app uses colors, timing, and randomization to challenge users.
